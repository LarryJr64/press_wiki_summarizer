# press_wiki_summarizer

The main objective of this project is to build an NLP method to summarize articles from newspapes websites and from wikipedia.

We then created a streamlit application to easily use this script. Inside the application, the user only has to insert the link of the articles he wants to have a summary of.

This application works for wikipedia and for these sites (only free contents) : lemonde.fr, lefigaro.fr, leparisien.fr, lesechos.fr, liberation.fr, lequipe.fr, bbc.com
